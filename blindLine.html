    <h1>Blind Line</h1>
    <div id="output">Blind Line is an improv game where players perform a scene together while one actor is secretly assigned a line of dialogue they must deliver at the appropriate moment. The twist is that the actor doesn't know the line in advance, so when it's time to speak, they have to smoothly integrate the unexpected line into the ongoing scene.</div>
