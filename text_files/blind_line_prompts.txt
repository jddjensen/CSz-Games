"Just another day in paradise."
"The music stopped, and the world followed."
"She left her perfume on my jacket, and now I can’t stop smelling ghosts."

"The only thing worse than losing is almost winning."
"He had a plan. Too bad it sucked."
"They say lightning never strikes twice, but I wasn’t willing to test that theory."
